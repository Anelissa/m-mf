medicine bag support

plan so far:

[y] mmconfig medicinebag

[y] show medicinebag on mmconfig
[y] mmconfig mdbaghealth

[y] fix mm.prio.import to insert items properly
[y] ensure that medicinebag is above healhealth by default in both sync and async
[y] add medicinebag onto sip balance, to handle sipping only
[y] add medicinebag to prio above health on first run
[y] separate medicine bag levels for health (apply/sip values)
[y] insert medicine bag to be at a higher priority than health by default

disable medicinebag bag when bag runs out of charges (AI checked) and when there is no more bag when you try to rub

separate medicine bag levels for wounds

[?] involve balance priorities - so if bag is higher than health, and it's sipping % is lower, then it'll take effect at lower while health will be used at higher
